# ThinkDesign Pro ‚Äî Windows Workflow Kit (2025)

ThinkDesign Pro on Windows is assembled for artists and engineers who want dependable performance, predictable color, and painless interchange between tools.

This repository curates working presets, naming rules, and end‚Äëto‚Äëend workflows specific to **ThinkDesign Pro** so you can move from first sketch to final frames with fewer surprises.

It focuses on Windows 10/11 tuning (drivers, caches, GPU modes) and on the IO that ThinkDesign Pro users actually pass to other apps (USD, FBX, STEP, EXR, and more).
